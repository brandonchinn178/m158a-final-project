M158A Final Project
===================

Fall 2016, UC Berkeley

My final project for MUSIC 158A involves accessing the Spotify API. In order to download the audio features for a song, this Flask app exposes an `/audio-features` endpoint that will do all the authorization calls behind the scenes and return the features for the given track, to be used in the Max MSP application.
